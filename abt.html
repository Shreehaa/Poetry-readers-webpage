<p>“Poetry is the revelation of a feeling that the poet believes to be interior and personal which the reader recognizes as his own.”
  <br>
  <p>

  Mary Oliver
  <br>
  “Poetry isn’t a profession, it’s a way of life. It’s an empty basket; you put your life into it and make something out of that.”
</p>
<p>
  T.S. Eliot
  <br>
  “Poetry is not a turning loose of emotion, but an escape from emotion; it is not the expression of personality, but an escape from personality. But, of course, only those who have personality and emotions know what it means to want to escape from these things.”
</p>

<p>
  Matthew Arnold
  <br>
  “Poetry is at bottom a criticism of life; that the greatness of a poet lies in his powerful and beautiful application of ideas to life — to the question: How to live.”
</p>
<p>
  Dylan Thomas
  <br>
  “Poetry is what in a poem makes you laugh, cry, prickle, be silent, makes your toe nails twinkle, makes you want to do this or that or nothing, makes you know that you are alone in the unknown world, that your bliss and suffering is forever shared and forever all your own.”
</p> 
  
<p>From Carl Sandburg’s 
  “Tentative (First Model): Definitions of Poetry”:
  
  1. Poetry is a projection across silence of cadences arranged to break that silence with definite intentions of echoes, syllables, wave lengths.
 <br> 
  2. Poetry is an art practised with the terribly plastic material of human language.
  <br>
  3. Poetry is the report of a nuance between two moments, when people say, ‘Listen!’ and ‘Did you see it’ ‘Did you hear it? What was it?’
  <br>
  4. Poetry is the tracing of the trajectories of a finite sound to the infinite points of its echoes.
  <br>
  5. Poetry is a sequence of dots and dashes, spelling depths, crypts, cross-lights, and moon wisps.
  <br>
  6. Poetry is a puppet-show, where riders of skyrockets and divers of sea fathoms gossip about the sixth sense and the fourth dimension.
  <br>
  7. Poetry is a plan for a slit in the face of a bronze fountain goat and the path of fresh drinking water.
  <br>
  8. Poetry is a slipknot tightened around a time-beat of one thought, two thoughts, and a last interweaving thought there is not yet a number for.
  <br>
  9. Poetry is an echo asking a shadow dancer to be a partner.
  <br>
  10. Poetry is the journal of a sea animal living on land, wanting to fly the air.

    Peanut Butter Stirs an Old Debate: To the T.S.A., What’s a Liquid?
    
    Jaylen Brown on Basketball, Activism and Being Black in Boston
    You can live a full life without knowing a scrap of poetry, just as you can live a full life without ever seeing a Picasso or “The Cherry Orchard.” Most people surround themselves with art of some sort, whether it’s by Amy Winehouse or Richard Avedon. Even the daubs on the refrigerator by the toddler artist have their place. Language gainfully employed has its place. Poetry will never have the audience of “Game of Thrones” — that is what television can do. Poetry is what language alone can do.</p>
